			<p>During my long long life here on this planet I've lived in various states in the US for school, work, and play.  This game will test you to see if you can guess how many and which ones.  Here are some hints.  I went to school at <abbr title="Yes there really is a Kalamazoo.">Kalamazoo College</abbr> and I worked for <abbr title="National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration">NOAA</abbr> for ten years.
